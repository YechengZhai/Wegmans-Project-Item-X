# Wegmans-Project-Item-X
By working with the Wegmans data to do marketing research and conduct some initial analyses to drive analytics design.

# Conclusion
Identify customers who are likely to buy after marketing;
segment them according to their profile, demography,psychology, and geography; implement precise marketing onthem.

Find out attributes customers care to promote/improve the product.

When negative customer choose more than one attribute as “N-”, the survey data can not tell which one is the key barrier.

Attribute M is not the main barrier to purchase.

If we can raise awareness of Item-X, there will be marked improvement.
